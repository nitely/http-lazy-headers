    The ``If-Unmodified-Since`` header field makes the request\
    method conditional on the selected representation's\
    last modification date being earlier than or equal to\
    the date provided in the field-value. This field\
    accomplishes the same purpose as If-Match for cases\
    where the user agent does not have an entity-tag for\
    the representation.

    Example::

        IfUnmodifiedSince([
            datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=1)
        ])
