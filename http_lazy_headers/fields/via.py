class Via(bases.MultiHeaderBase):
    """
    The ``Via`` header field indicates the\
    presence of intermediate protocols and\
    recipients between the user agent and the\
    server (on requests) or between the origin\
    server and the client (on responses),\
    similar to the "Received" header field in\
    email. Via can be used for tracking message\
    forwards, avoiding request loops, and\
    identifying the protocol capabilities of\
    senders along the request/response chain.

    Example::

        Vary([
            via(
                received_protocol='1.0',
                received_by='fred',

                received_protocol='1.1',
                received_by='p.example.net'])
